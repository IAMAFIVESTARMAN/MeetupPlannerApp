Just playing around with NextJS 13 

## Getting Started
# MeetupPlannerApp

Since Next is full stack builder, you can use route handling to send data and fetch data. 
I used mongodb atlas so you'd need a connection string
First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can other functionality as well,it uses react under the hood
To learn more about Next.js, take a look at the following resources:

- [Next.js Documentation](https://nextjs.org/docs) - learn about Next.js features and API. | App routing is  stable with v13
- [Learn Next.js](https://nextjs.org/learn) - an interactive Next.js tutorial. | Outdated but it's fine if you are working page routing

You can check out [the Next.js GitHub repository](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/) - your feedback and contributions are welcome!
